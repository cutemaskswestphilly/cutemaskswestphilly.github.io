## To edit the image

1. Locally, name your new image `image.jpeg` (must be exactly that)

1. Click "Add file" and "Upload files"
1. Drag `image.jpeg` into the drag-and-drop field and wait for the upload to complete
1. Scroll down and click the green "Commit changes" button

Done! It may take ~ 20 minutes for the webpage content to be refreshed

## If you want a new favicon

1. Find an image you want to use
1. Convert it to a favicon with https://favicon.io/
1. Download the result (it will probably be a bundle of images - you only need the one called favicon.ico)
1. Follow the above instructions but upload the file with the name `favicon.ico` (must be exactly that)
